      <h2>What we are about</h2>
      <p>Prevailing Prayer Ministry aims to teach and lead the church in both individual and corporate prayer.<br>
        We will not seek our own will through our own efforts but we will humbly come before God with a repentant heart seeking His will.<br>
        We submit to Jesus Christ as the Head of the church and will strive to obey His command that His church should be called a House of Prayer.</p>
